# Changelog
## Version 2.3
- Fix: pixels with "color" but full transparency now won't count towards half pixels
- Fix: Necrozma body autogens are now hidden as it turns out the sheets show Ultra Necrozma instead

## Version 2.2
- **Autogens are back!** Analyzed fusions will have the corresponding autogen sprite in the analysis embed
- **Triple** fusion and **Egg** sprite support
- Detect other image formats "disguised" as PNGs

## Version 2.1
- New Hoenn dex numbers
- **Spriter application checks:** it will do an auto-analysis of the 3 sprites and check if their spritework threads have been created over a day ago
- **Misnumbered IDs:** when a gallery posts has a misnumbered ID between message and filename, the gallery message will be deleted and sent to the user to be able to fix and repost it
- **Zigzag** posts in the galleries will now be analyzed
- It will now detect when there's no half pixels but it doesn't adhere to the grid

## Version 2.0
- **Similarity score** now works with **indexed mode** sprites (previously it was always 0)
- **Pokemon names** are now displayed when the dex IDs are valid
- **Similar command**: it will return a text list with at most 20 pairs of similar colors that could be merged into a single shade.
- **Assets gallery support** for custom bases, which will also display their pokemon name in the analysis.
- **High similarity warnings** and different similarity and color count restrictions, depending on if it's a fusion or custom base.
- Fix: the bot won't flip out when a single message has multiple different fusion with their IDs in the message
