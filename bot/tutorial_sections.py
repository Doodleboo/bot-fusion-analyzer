filename = TutorialSection(

    content="With fusion sprites, your filename should be 2 numbers, with a dot in between.\n"
            "For instance: **102.463.png** (most likely, your program will add the png part on its own)\n"
            "The numbers represent the pokedex numbers of the pokemon in your fusion. "
            "**Warning:** Infinite Fusion uses different pokedex numbers, so don't take them from the main games!"
            "Instead, use the **dex command** to know the filenames. For example, write: `dex Ludicolo/Probopass`"
            "in a message, and you will trigger the command.\n"

colors = TutorialSection(

    content="In pixel art, and particularly here, the amount of colors used in a sprite matters. Pokemon sprites "
            "were limited to 16 but we use more.\nIf it's for a fusion, try to keep it below 32. Make each color "
            "count and try to re-use colors whenever possible.\n"
            "For more information, check out the relevant part of the Spriting Guidelines: "

similarity = TutorialSection(

    description="What does it mean? How much is too much similarity?",
    content="A common misconception is that it's measuring how similar your sprite is to something else. Far from it!\n"
            "It's grabbing the colors you used on your sprite, and comparing them against eachother. This is to ensure "
            "that your colors are distinct enough.\nIf it's for a fusion, try to keep your similarity to 7 or below. "
            "Anything over 10 most of the time means that you have some unaccounted colors in there that are *almost "
            "identical* to others you used, yet not quite the same shade.\nWrite ?tag analyser for a link to a website"
            "that will show you which color pairs are the most similar, so that you can convert them into a single "
            "color.\nYou can use the /similar command to check the color pairs too!"

grid = TutorialSection(
    title="Grid alignment",
    description="What does it mean if it says 'not aligned to the grid'?",
    content="If you see **not aligned to the grid** in a bot analysis, it means that after upscaling your sprite to "
            "288x288, you may have moved it in the canvas. But don't worry about this, as when the sprite is brought "
            "into the game, this misalignment will be automatically fixed.\n"
            "This warning on the bot is mostly so that people are aware of it."

size = TutorialSection(
    title="Sprite size",
    description="What's invalid size? Which size should I use?",
    content="Make sure you create sprites that are 96 pixels tall and wide. Then, you upscale them 300%. This lands "
            "it at a size of **288x288 pixels**. If you edit it after upscaling, you may run into **half pixels**.\n"
            "If you came across half pixels, check out that tutorial section too."

half_pixels = TutorialSection(
    title="Half pixels",
    description="What are half pixels? How do I detect them?",
    content="**Half pixels** occur when, for instance, one edits a sprite *after* they've upscaled them to 288x288. "
            "When you upscale a sprite, what was originally a pixel now becomes a square that's 3 pixels wide and "
            "tall. That means that the whole sprite should follow this pattern automatically. But if there's something "
            "that breaks that pattern, that's a half pixel. You can notice them if you zoom in and realize some spots "
            "look 'out of place'.\n"
            "In some cases, the *entire sprite* may be half pixels. This probably means that the sprite you had "
            "originally wasn't 96x96, so upscaling it made a bunch of half pixels appear. Try to recover the image "
            "before upscaling if you have it, and try upscaling with an external website. If you write `?tag upscaler` "
            "you will be linked to one of these.\n"
